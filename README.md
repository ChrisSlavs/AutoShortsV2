# AutoShortsV2
Remake of a previous video automation script I have made

Why do this???
    Well I was very unsatisfied with the spaghetti, procedural style programming used to make the first version. As I have become more familiar and worked out the kinks with the tools used in the script (ffmpeg, various ai tools) I feel this deserves a rewrite.

Goals:
    More object oriented style programming, preferably a mix of procedural and OOP

    Color formatting of subtitles


# TODO
    Create file structure
    test and debug
